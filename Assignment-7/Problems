1. Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums
such that the sum is closest to the target.[Amazon]
You need to return the sum of three integers.
For example:arr = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: [-1+2+1] = 2 (The sum that is closest to the target is 2)

2. Given three points, check whether they lie on a straight (collinear) or not. [Google]
For example:
Input- [(1,1), (1,6), (0,9)]
Output- No
Input- [(1,1), (1,4), (1,5)]
Output- Yes

3. An e-commerce site tracks the purchases made each day. The product that is purchased
the most one day is the featured product for the following day. If there is a tie for the product
purchased most frequently, those product names are ordered alphabetically ascending and
the last name in the list is chosen.[Amazon]
['yellowShirt', 'redHat', 'blackShirt', 'bluePants', 'redHat','pinkHat', 'blackShirt', 'yellowShirt',
'greenPants', 'greenPants', 'greenPants']
'yellowShirt' - 2
'redHat' - 2
'blackShirt' - 2
'bluePants' - 1
'greenPants' - 3
'pinkHat' - 1
Output - greenPants

4. An almost sorted array is given to us and the task is to sort that array completely. Then,
